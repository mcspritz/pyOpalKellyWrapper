pyOpalKellyWrapper
==================

A (probably) simpler way to use the Opal Kelly drivers, please help me to improve it if you can.

==================

SETUP

Copy the folders of the Opal Kelly drivers into this folder to be able to use the wrapper.
The two folders are named:
32bit/
64bit/

==================

USE

The wrapper uses a csv file to translate addresses to signal names.
This should help the programming realeasing the programmer from remembering what each
address does.
An example is in the file OK_Register_Config.csv, not all the fields are used but they were
important in another script (and is not important for the wrapper, I'll check if I can publish it or
translate it into python code)
